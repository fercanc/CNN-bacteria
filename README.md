LE WAGON DATA SCIENCE BOOTCAMP FINAL PROJECT

With a team of 4 we created an image recognition model using transfer learning and convolutional neural networks to classify different bacteria species from petri dish images. This will save time and money when used in the clinical diagnostic process. The current diagnostic process is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.

Database:Â 

1000 high resolution petri dish images consisting of 5 different bacteria species.

Result:

The created model predicts bacterial species with 95% to 97.5% accuracy. Next steps would be masking and segmentation to isolate individual bacterial colonies, which could improve model performance. (We were not able to finish and test this within the 2 week time limit of the project.)

The Google Cloud Platform was used for the project because of the computational load.

My contributions: 
* Grid searching different parameters. 
* Testing and comparing different models and fine tuning the best model. (Xception, VGG16, Densenet169, EfficientNetB7, ResNet50 are tested) 
* Recording, analyzing and visualizing metrics for presentation.
