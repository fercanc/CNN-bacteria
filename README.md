CNN-bacteria

Project for creating an image recognition model using convolutional neural networks to classify different bacteria species from petri dish images to be used in clinical diagnostic process.

Database: 1000 high resolution petri dish images consisting of 5 different bacteria species.

We were not able to finish fully within the 2 weeks project timeline but next steps would be masking and segmentation to isolate individual bacteria colonies. 

Google Cloud platform was used for computational load.
